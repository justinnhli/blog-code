## Verification Lab, Part 2

1. Consider the vignettes below:

	* John O'Connell-Chapman Jr. (41) is a local small-business owner, looking to advertise with student clubs on campus. He has merged his personal number with his business number. He welcomes you to try their food by calling [+323 NU-SUSHI](tel:3236878744) or emailing [orders@nu-sushi.com](mailto:orders@nu-sushi.com).

	* Chun Ying Tsang (20) is an exchange student from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England. He only just moved into his dorm yesterday. Although Chun Ying has an email address ([Terrif.Ying@yahoo.com](mailto:Terrif.Ying@yahoo.com)), he only has his UK cell phone [+44 075 9921 9264](tel:4407599219264).

	* Ash Poulopoulos has been invited to speak at an event co-hosted by DEB and Project SAFE. Drawing on personal experience growing up, Ash will be talking about the discrimination faced by the transgender community, and how allies can support those who are transitioning. Due to previous harassment, Ash refused to give out any personal information, instead directing you to the [National Center for Transgender Equality](http://www.transequality.org/) website.

	Without changing your program, try to enter the information from these visitors. What happens? Does your program work? If not, where does it fail?

2. Read through the following webpages:

	* [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/)
	* [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Address](https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/)
	* [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Geography](http://wiesmann.codiferes.net/wordpress/?p=15187)
	* Unrelated to this lab, but in a similar vein, 
[Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Time](http://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time), or in video form, [The Problem with Time & Timezones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY)

3. **Individually** answer the questions below. You can discuss ideas for your answers, but the writing should be your own. Aim for a short paragraph for each of the bullet points.

	1. Does your program work for the visitors at the beginning of Part 2? If not, why not? What assumptions did you make about the personal information of the visitors? What assumptions did you make about how this information would be entered?
	2. How would you change your program so that it wouldn't fail? You do not have to actually make the changes, only describe what you would do.
	3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing this?
	4. Look through the "Falsehoods..." links above. Why might programmers care about these things?
	5. Facebook calls your social contacts "friends", but many of those people may be closer to acquaintances. Facebook also only allows a single relationship status and restricts it to one of several choices, excluding other lifestyles (what if someone was polyamorous and in multiple relationships?). Come up with two other examples where (well-intentioned) technical decisions have (unintended) negative consequences. Be sure to explain why the intentions were noble, but how it ultimately leads to undesirable results.
	6. What have you learned about the responsibility of programmers when writing code that represent and is used in the real world? How might you approach this in the future?

4. Submit your code from Part 1 to the autograder (there are no test cases) and email me your answers to the questions above.
